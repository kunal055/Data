Preq:-

1.Find/Create new container on 19C.
2.Check/Schedule backup of newly created contianer i.e Target Container .
3.Newly created contaniner should be in OEM.
4.Check size of the source DB ,If Db size in TB's try running PDB creation script in nohup

Implementation

move_pdb	(root, contains only catalogs)
-	conf	(Contains one configuration file for the scripts)
-	source_primary (Scripts to run from source primary)
-	source_standby (Scripts to run from source standby)
-	target_primary (Scripts to run from target primary)
-	target_standby (Scripts to run from target standby)
-	Various helper scripts

1.We need to prepare scripts as per enviornment, In below script(Config File) we need to make changes

[oracle@db-s009hh01d conf]$ cat move_pdb.conf

CDB_SOURCE=s0312t1h--------------------------------------Source DB name
CDB_TARGET=s0200t1h---------------------------------------Target DB name
CDB_RUNNING_INSTANCES=s0312t1h-----------------------------Source DB running instance name
CDB_MIGRATE_SERVICE=s0312t----------------------------------Service name use for creating DB link
CDB_REMOTE_USER=c##clonesNDFCOMA----------------------------User name which needs to be created
CLONE_LINK=clone_NDFCOMA_link------------------------------DB link name which needs to be created
VIP=db-s009hh01d.qaoneadr.local----------------------------Vip of where DB is runnning

PDB_SOURCE=P_NDFCOMA_DBFA_21022311_S----------------------Source PDB name
PDB_TARGET=P_NDFCOMA_DBFA_21022311_S-----------------------Target DB name(We can change the name as well as per requirement)
PDB_PREFERRED_INSTANCES=s0200t1h3,s0200t1h4----------------On which instances services should run
PDB_AVAILABLE_INSTANCES=s0200t1h3,s0200t1h4-----------------On which instances services should run
PDB_MIGRATE_SERVICE=pdb_NDFCOMA_migrate---------------------New service will be created for migration
PDB_PRIMARY_SERVICE=ndfcomas--------------------------------Theese should be same service as running on Source DB
PDB_STANDBY_SERVICE=ndfcomas_ro-----------------------------Theese should be same service as running on Source DB
PDB_NODBOT_SERVICE=s_ndfcoma_dbfa_21022311_s----------------Theese should be same service as running on Source DB

2.Then we have to go to source DB  source_primary (Scripts to run from source primary) and run below scripts in particular order

[oracle@db-s003hh03d source_primary]$ 

1.1_pre_check_source.sh-----------It will provide general information about source DB
2.2_create_user_clone.sh-----------User will be created (CDB_REMOTE_USER=c##clonesNDFCOMA)
3.3_create_migrate_service.sh------Migrate service will be created(PDB_MIGRATE_SERVICE=pdb_NDFCOMA_migrate)
4.4_open_read_only.sh--------------This script will schut down PDB an dopen DB in read only mode
5.5_start_migrate_service.sh--------It will start the above created migrated service.

3.Then we have to go to Target DB in target_primary (Scripts to run from target primary) and run below scripts in particular order

1.6_create_db_link.sh----------------DB link will be created(CLONE_LINK=clone_NDFCOMA_link)
2.7_create_pdb.sh--------------------PDB will be craeted on target Db using DB link(this script takes time,Depending upon size of DB)
3.8_pdb_info.sh---------------------.It will provide new Created PDB and its state(will be in mount stage)
4.9_prepare_patch.sh----------------It will Open DB in read write mode
5.10_check_pdb_violations.sh--------PDB violations will be checked in this step
6.11_execute_datapatch.sh-----------Datapatch will be applied to PDB.
7.12_prepare_upgrade.sh------------This script will put DB in migrate mode(You can check by "show pdbs" command) and you have to manually fire catupgrade script for upgrade

Execute below script.

cd $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin
$ORACLE_HOME/perl/bin/perl catctl.pl -c P_CBPPHTLSM_CBA_20110314_T $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/catupgrd.sql(30 mins)

8.13_post_pdb.sh:- ----------It will show in DB in read write mode,If DB is read write mode and no error in catupgrd script,then DB is upgraded to 19C.
9.14_add_service.sh---------All the services will be created mentioned in lat in config script above,If services are not created ,we have to manually create service through srvctl command.

Example:-srvctl add service -s ndfcomas -d s0200t1h -preferred s0200t1h3,s0200t1h4 -pdb P_NDFCOMA_DBFA_21022311_S

4.Change DNS as per target DB host,You need to Modify Cname in ITSSP

The design is that ora-<db>-a => scan listener in site HH
and that ora-<db>-b => scan listener in site OE

5.Verification:-

a.nslookup tns entry(it should target DB host)
b. Make client connection like below,if succesfull only then handover to Application team

sqlplus sys@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=ora-cvarcd-a.qaoneadr.local)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=cvarcd))) as sysdba

6.Post steps:-

a.Check pdb is being shown in OEM or not,If its not showing manually add PDB in OEM.
b.Check backup
c.Close PDB and stop all services related to upgraded DB in Source .


6.Rollback Plan

we can simply shutdown and open source DB which is in read only stage.
